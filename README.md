# JeevVeda — AI-Powered Early Stage Cancer Screening

> **JeevVeda** is an integrated AI healthcare suite for early-stage cancer screening, combining a symptom-based medical assistant chatbot, blood report analyser (OCR + Gemini API), MRI image analyser (CNN), and an interactive DICOM viewer.

---

## 🔬 Project Overview

JeevVeda aims to shorten time-to-diagnosis and improve diagnostic accuracy by providing clinicians and patients with a compact, end-to-end screening toolkit:

* **Medical Assistance Chatbot** — NLP-based symptom intake and risk estimation (Low / Medium / High).
* **Blood Report Analyzer** — OCR + parsing pipeline to extract lab values and forward them to **Gemini 2.5 Pro API** for cancer risk analysis.
* **MRI Image Analyzer** — CNN-based (ResNet50) model to highlight suspicious nodules and provide malignancy probabilities.
* **DICOM Viewer** — Browser-based canvas viewer for interactive review of medical images (window/level, zoom, pan, multi-frame navigation).

This repo contains the code and resources for prototype development and research experiments.

## ✨ Key Features

* Natural-language symptom intake with feature mapping.
* Tesseract OCR + PDF/image parsing for blood reports.
* Extracted values sent to **Gemini 2.5 Pro API** for risk assessment and insights.
* ResNet50 CNN pipeline (preprocessing → inference → localization overlays) for MRI scans.
* Next.js API routes powering the backend inside `/src/app/api/`.
* Interactive React dashboard with modules for chatbot, analyzer, MRI, and DICOM.

## 📦 Models & Data

* **MRI model:** ResNet50-based CNN trained on annotated MRI/CT slices. Weights stored in `models/mri/` or hosted in cloud storage.
* **Blood analysis:** Relies on **Gemini 2.5 Pro API** for biomarker interpretation and risk scoring.
* **Symptom model:** Small LR/NN trained on symptom→diagnosis mapping.

**Datasets:** Keep sensitive/PHI data out of the repo. Provide synthetic/anonymized samples in `data/sample/` for demos.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation & Explainability

* Use metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC for classifiers.
* For MRI detections: IoU, sensitivity, ROC curves.
* Explainability:

  * **Gemini API structured outputs** for blood analysis.
  * **Grad-CAM / CAM overlays** for MRI model interpretability.

---

## 🧾 Compliance & Ethics

This project is a **research / prototype** tool. It is not a regulated medical device. For any clinical deployment:

* Obtain IRB / ethical approvals.
* Ensure PHI protection (HIPAA / local laws).
* Validate clinically with radiologists.
* Add disclaimers in UI/docs.
